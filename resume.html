    <h1>Recommendation letter</h1>
    <p>
    10.01.2022
    To whom it may concern:
    I had a pleasure of teaching Ruslanov Almaz from 2014 to 2019 at H. Karasaev High School. During that time, I have come to know him as a strong student and a role model for his peers. Almaz took English from me and earned superior grades in that class. Based on his grades, attendance, and class participation, I would rate Almaz's academic performance in my class as superior.
    Almaz is a rare type of student who combines exceptional natural ability with a willingness and eagerness to learn. He is able to help his peers with difficult English concepts, but does so in a way that is both practical and non-condescending. Although he is aware of his natural ability in the area of English, he constantly challenges himself. He plays defense in our school's soccer team. Moreover, he is interested in software engineering and media.
    While studying, he demonstrated himself as a responsible, diligent student. In addition, he was an enthusiastic participant in class discussions, activities and helped make the courses rewarding experience for everyone. He always supported his peers. His caring nature and personality allow him to work well with others in a team setting as he always respects others' opinions even when they differ from his own.
    Almazâ€™s personal strengths are as impressive as his intellectual accomplishments. He is an active, outgoing student with great sense of humor. He is a perfect person to get a group project rolling, but he also knows how to sit back and let others take the lead. His cheerful nature and openness to feedback, which is an impressive strength that will continue to serve him well in college and beyond, shows his constant will towards learning and growing as a learner.
    Another thing I want to mention is his wide range of interests. Besides the main subjects, he goes to courses in science and computing, in learning of which he achieved very good results. Therefore, without any hesitation, I can recommend Ruslanov Almaz for the position of a student in your university.

    Your faithfully,
    Jakeshov Zhyrgal.
